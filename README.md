# Time-Series Forecasting of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ)
---

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on the time-series forecasting of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ) concentrations to monitor air quality and predict future trends. Using advanced time-series analysis and machine learning models, we aim to:

- Identify seasonal trends and patterns.
- Forecast pollutant levels to enable proactive environmental monitoring.
- Evaluate and optimize models for accurate predictions.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of historical air quality measurements, including:

- **Date** and **Time**: Timestamp of each observation.
- **CO (GT)**: Ground truth concentration of Carbon Monoxide (mg/m¬≥).
- **NO‚ÇÇ (GT)**: Ground truth concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (¬µg/m¬≥).
- **Other Variables**:
  - **Temperature (T)**: Ambient temperature (¬∞C).
  - **Relative Humidity (RH)**: Percentage of relative humidity.
  - **Absolute Humidity (AH)**: Absolute humidity values.

### **Data Preprocessing**
1. **Handling Missing Data**: Interpolation was used to fill missing values.
2. **Normalization**: Variables were scaled using MinMaxScaler.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Explored relationships between variables to identify key features affecting pollutant levels.
4. **Seasonality Analysis**: Seasonal trends were extracted using decomposition techniques.

---

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1. **Correlation Matrix**:
   - Positive correlation between **CO** and **NO‚ÇÇ** levels.
   - Significant impact of **Temperature (T)** and **Relative Humidity (RH)** on pollutant concentrations.

2. **Seasonality Insights**:
   - Monthly and daily seasonality patterns identified for both pollutants.
   - Peak NO‚ÇÇ levels observed during colder months.

---

## **Models Implemented**
The following models were evaluated for forecasting:

1. **SARIMAX** (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables):
   - Effective for capturing linear trends and seasonality.

2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
   - A deep learning model designed for sequential data.
   - Captures long-term dependencies and nonlinear relationships.

3. **Baseline Models**:
   - Naive forecasting for comparison.

## **Model Performance**

| **Pollutant**  | **Model** | **MAE**   | **RMSE**  | **R¬≤**   |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **CO (GT)**    | SARIMAX   | 0.06      | 0.08      | 0.76      |
|                | LSTM      | 0.05      | 0.07      | 0.82      |
| **NO‚ÇÇ (GT)** | SARIMAX   | 0.12      | 0.18      | 0.15      |
|                | LSTM      | 0.10      | 0.16      | 0.28      |

### **Findings**
- **SARIMAX** is effective for interpretable and seasonal patterns but struggles with nonlinear relationships.
- **LSTM** outperforms SARIMAX for CO forecasting with better generalization to complex patterns.

## **Key Insights**
1. **CO Levels**:
   - Strong correlation with temperature.
   - LSTM achieved the highest accuracy for predicting CO levels.

2. **NO‚ÇÇ Levels**:
   - Seasonal trends dominate NO‚ÇÇ levels.
   - Both SARIMAX and LSTM require further tuning to improve performance.

3. **Feature Importance**:
   - Temperature (T) and Humidity (RH) significantly impact pollutant concentrations.

## **Visualization**
1. **Correlation Heatmap**:
   - Visualized relationships between pollutants and meteorological variables.

2. **Seasonality Analysis**:
   - Plots showed monthly and daily pollutant variations.

3. **Model Predictions**:
   - Comparison of actual vs. predicted values demonstrated LSTM‚Äôs superiority for CO.
